# Fremont Email Composer

## Overview

The Fremont Email Composer is a simple, web-based tool designed to facilitate residents of Fremont in composing and sending emails to city council members regarding community concerns. This tool allows users to select predefined subjects related to community issues and automatically formats the email body, subject, and recipient address based on user selection. Additionally, users have the option to send a BCC (Blind Carbon Copy) to a monitoring email address to help track the number of emails sent.

## Features

- **Predefined Subjects**: Users can choose from a list of subjects related to community concerns.
- **Customizable Content**: The tool allows users to edit the email subject and body to tailor the message according to their preferences.
- **Recipient Selection**: Users can select the council member they wish to address from a dropdown menu.
- **BCC Option**: A checkbox is provided to allow users to opt-in or opt-out of sending a copy of the email to a monitoring address for counting purposes. This option is enabled by default but can be unchecked by the user.

## How to Use

1. **Select a Recipient**: Choose a council member from the dropdown list.
2. **Choose a Subject**: Select a predefined subject, which will automatically populate the subject line and body of the email.
3. **Customize Your Message**: Edit the subject and body of the email as needed.
4. **Send a Copy for Counting**: Leave the "Send a copy to us for counting" checkbox checked if you agree to send a BCC to the monitoring email. Uncheck it if you prefer not to.
5. **Compose Email**: Click on the "Compose Email" button, which will open your default email client with the recipient, subject, and body already filled out based on your selections.
